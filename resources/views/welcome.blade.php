    <p>
        Welcome to the planning app built for the psychiatry residents at University Hospitals in Cleveland, Ohio. Updated hourly, you can see your remaining call days, vacation taken/dates remaining, and remaining rotation schedule. More importantly, you can plan your vacations and call switches with ease by with the built in logic system. You'll be able to see every call that needs switched, each shift you can trade with, and logic as to why you can't switch others.
